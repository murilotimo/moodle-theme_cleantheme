Cleantheme is based on moodle "Clean" theme.

**** To enable "advance course search" ****

Either you can copy file renderer.php file to your theme renderer.php file.

* replace /theme/cleantheme/renderer.php with /theme/yourtheme/renderer.php

OR you may install cleantheme.

you just need to replace renderer that will override core_course_renderer.

Thanks :)
